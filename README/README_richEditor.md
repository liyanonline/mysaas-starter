ðŸ”¥ Do you want me to:

    âœ… Add drag-and-drop image upload (with preview & storage)?

    âœ… Make toolbar modern like Medium?

    âœ… Add custom video upload instead of YouTube only?

    âœ… Full code for NewCaseForm + RichTextEditor + Post Detail Page rendering?

âœ… Do you want:

    Supabase / S3 image storage (instead of public/uploads)?

    Multiple image uploads with gallery preview?

    Toolbar with video upload (MP4) instead of just YouTube links?

    Save uploaded images in DB for cleanup and CDN links?

Which one should I implement for you now?

âœ… Do you want me to:

âœ” Convert this into a reusable <RichTextEditor /> component with full toolbar?
âœ” Add drag-and-drop + file upload to GCP bucket or Supabase for production?
âœ” Add automatic image compression & validation (max size)?

Which option should I build for you? Local storage or cloud storage?
