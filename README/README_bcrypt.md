Your Vercel build is failing because of this error:

```
Type error: Could not find a declaration file for module 'bcrypt'.
```

This is a **TypeScript** issue, not a runtime error. The problem is that TypeScript doesn't have type definitions for the `bcrypt` module by default. There are **two main ways** to fix this.

---

### ‚úÖ **Fix Option 1: Install `@types/bcrypt` (Recommended)**

Run this in your project:

```bash
pnpm add -D @types/bcrypt
```

Or if you're using npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/bcrypt
```

Then redeploy to Vercel. This will provide the missing TypeScript types and resolve the compile error.

---

### ‚úÖ **Fix Option 2: Manually declare the module**

If for some reason the types package doesn't work or isn't available, you can manually declare the module.

Create a `types` folder (if it doesn't exist), then inside it create a file `bcrypt.d.ts`:

```
/types/bcrypt.d.ts
```

```ts
declare module "bcrypt";
```

Then, ensure `tsconfig.json` includes the types folder:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "typeRoots": ["./types", "./node_modules/@types"]
  }
}
```

### üîÅ Optional: Consider Switching to `bcryptjs`

Since `bcrypt` requires native bindings, sometimes it causes problems during deployment, especially in serverless environments like Vercel. You could instead use [`bcryptjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs), a pure JavaScript alternative:

```bash
pnpm add bcryptjs
```

Then replace in your code:

```ts
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs";
```

It has the same `compare`, `hash` API, and is easier to deploy.

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR ‚Äì What You Should Do Now

```bash
pnpm add -D @types/bcrypt
```

Then redeploy your app. If that doesn't fix it, fall back to the manual declaration or `bcryptjs` alternative.
